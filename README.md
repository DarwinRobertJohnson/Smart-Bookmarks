# Challenges faced during the development phase

    1. Design of the web application for a seemingly simple application led to overdesigning, but eventually settled
    on a simpler architecture

    Authentication -> business functions / main functionality -> database interaction
                                                                
    2. Boiler plate mayhem, since the functionality of the application was rather simple, slogging through the boiler plate felt too overwhelming, but thanks to AI assisstant ChatGPT, I was able to cut through the boiler plate and wire things correctly

    3. Styling paralysis, made the mistake of trying to balance development of functionality and styling at the same time, but project requirement guided me back on track by making me understand what was valued was the functionality and performance, So I settled for bare minimum styling

    4. Tailwing hurricane, for a seemingly simple UI library, it's documentation is organised in a rather  intimidating manner elevating its complexity for someone who primarily worked with bootstrap, but again thanks to ChatGPT I was able to breeze through the docs and get exactly what I wanted.

    Note: Many minor bugs and dilemmas did arise during development, like always, but these 4 were the ones that stumped me and made me rethink my approaches and ground them to what is valued by the project requirements
